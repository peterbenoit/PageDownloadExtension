I. Content Script Comparison (WORKING_VERSION/content.js vs. src/content/...)

Toast UI & Functionality:

Missing: The src/content/components/toast.js provides a very basic toast structure. The WORKING_VERSION/content.js has a significantly more detailed and functional toast implementation, including:
A header with a title and close button.
Specific styling for a modern look (background, border-radius, shadow, fonts).
Detailed progress bar styling.
A dedicated, scrollable section (file-status-container) to display lists of successfully downloaded, skipped, and failed files, categorized with specific styling.
Accessibility features (role, aria-live, sr-only class, focus trapping).
Hover effects for the close button.
Logic to reset the status lists (showToast function).
Logic to dynamically display file status sections (completeToast, addFileStatus).
Inconsistency: The src version uses bottom: 20px, while the WORKING_VERSION uses top: 20px. The overall structure and features are vastly different.
Message Handling:

Inconsistency: The message types/actions handled are different.
WORKING_VERSION listens for: DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS, DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE, DOWNLOAD_STARTED, FILE_STATUS, LOG.
src listens for: scanPage, showToast, showProgress, updateProgress.
Missing: The src version lacks handlers for receiving detailed file status updates (FILE_STATUS) or logging messages from the background (LOG). The WORKING_VERSION's addFileStatus function, which populates the detailed file lists in the toast, is entirely missing in the src structure.
Resource Collection:

Inconsistency: WORKING_VERSION/content.js performs resource collection directly within the main IIFE using querySelectorAll for various tags (img, link, script, video), inline styles, and style elements. src/content/utils/messageHandler.js delegates this to an imported collectResources function (implementation not provided). The specific logic for finding resources (e.g., handling different quoting styles in url(), font detection methods) exists in WORKING_VERSION but its presence/equivalence in src/content/utils/resourceCollector.js is unknown.
Missing: The detailed selectors and regex used in WORKING_VERSION for extracting resources from inline styles and style tags are not present in the provided src files.
HTML Cleanup:

Missing: WORKING_VERSION/content.js includes a cleanupExtensionElements function to remove the toast and related elements from the HTML before sending it to the background script. This functionality is absent in the provided src files.
Data Transmission:

Inconsistency: WORKING_VERSION proactively sends a PAGE_DATA message containing domain, html, resources, and url. src/content/utils/messageHandler.js waits for a scanPage message from the background and then sends back html, resources, title, and url. The initiator and the exact data payload differ.
II. Background Script Comparison (WORKING_VERSION/background.js vs. src/background/...)

Core Processing Logic:

Missing: The main entry point and orchestration logic present in WORKING_VERSION/background.js (handling the PAGE_DATA message, calling processPageData, loading settings, iterating through resources, fetching, checking sizes, zipping, updating progress) is largely missing or incomplete in src/background/pageProcessor.js. The startPageDownload function in src outlines the process but crucially lacks the implementation for downloadResources.
Missing: Fetching logic with timeout, blob handling, size checks (MAX_RESOURCE_SIZE_MB, MAX_TOTAL_SIZE_MB), and adding files to the JSZip instance are present in WORKING_VERSION but missing in src.
HTML Modification:

Inconsistency: WORKING_VERSION/background.js has a modifyHTML function that uses string replacement (.replace()) to update local paths for CSS, JS, images and to remove specific analytics scripts after receiving the complete HTML string. src/background/htmlProcessor.js uses the DOMParser API to modify the DOM structure (e.g., img.src = resourcePath;) before serializing it back to a string. It also focuses on extracting resources and mapping paths rather than direct string replacement for all cases shown in WORKING_VERSION.
Missing: The specific logic in WORKING_VERSION/background.js's modifyHTML for replacing background image URLs and removing inline scripts containing gtag( or clarity( is not explicitly present in src/background/htmlProcessor.js.
Zipping and Downloading:

Missing: WORKING_VERSION/background.js uses JSZip to create the archive and chrome.downloads.download (via helper functions blobToDataURL and downloadURL) to save the file. This entire block is missing from the provided src files. The src/background/downloader.js module is imported but its content is not shown.
Progress and Status Updates:

Inconsistency: WORKING_VERSION sends DOWNLOAD_STARTED, DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS (with percentage), DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE (with filename), and detailed FILE_STATUS messages (success, skipped, failed with reasons) to the content script's specific listeners. src/background/pageProcessor.js uses a generic sendMessageToActiveTab helper (presumably from logger.js) to send downloadStarted, downloadComplete (with a summary object from fileStatus.js), and downloadError.
Missing: The granular, per-file status updates (updateFileStatus function and its usage during resource processing) and the percentage progress calculation/sending seen in WORKING_VERSION are missing in src.
Settings:

Missing: WORKING_VERSION/background.js loads and uses settings (maxResourceSize, maxTotalSize, downloadCss, etc.) via chrome.storage.sync.get. This is completely absent in the provided src background files.
File Naming:

Missing: WORKING_VERSION/background.js contains logic to determine the htmlFilename and a helper getZipFilename based on the page URL and domain. This logic is missing in src. src/background/htmlProcessor.js has a getResourceFilename helper, but the overall ZIP naming is not addressed.
Modularization:

Inconsistency: WORKING_VERSION has most logic within background.js and content.js. The src version attempts modularization (pageProcessor.js, htmlProcessor.js, toast.js, messageHandler.js, and imported but unseen logger.js, fileStatus.js, downloader.js, resourceCollector.js). However, significant parts of the core functionality seem missing from these src modules compared to the working version.
